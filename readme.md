# Matplotlib Animations

This repo holds my code for fooling around with matplotlib animations.

[Live Demos Here](https://zgul.de/stats/)

The code in here is not super well documented and the commit messages aren't
great, as the animations created here are intended to be public-facing, but the
code itself not so much.
